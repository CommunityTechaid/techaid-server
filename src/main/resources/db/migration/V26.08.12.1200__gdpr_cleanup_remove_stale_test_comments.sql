-- Replaces gdpr.performgdprcleanup() with the body production actually runs.
--
-- WHY
--   V26.08.12.1100 shipped the correct logic with two stale diagnostic comments left in the
--   function body:
--
--       -- TEMP-REVERT-FOR-TEST-D: drop the OR branch to prove B3 discriminates.
--
--   They sit directly above two of the three correction-4 audit-trail UPDATEs and instruct
--   the reader to delete the OR branch that closes the audit-trail gap (#127). The branch is
--   correctness-critical: without it, audit rows behind a request that is edited after being
--   scrubbed become permanently unreachable. A comment telling the next person to remove it
--   is a live hazard, and "TEMP" markers are exactly what someone tidies up in good faith.
--
--   V26.08.12.1100 also closes with a RAISE NOTICE reading "notes at 26 weeks", which
--   contradicts its own note 0 - the whole point of that note is that notes STAY at 52 weeks.
--   That message cannot be corrected in place: the migration is recorded as applied, and
--   editing the file changes its Flyway checksum and fails validation on the next boot.
--   This migration carries an accurate message instead.
--
-- BLAST RADIUS: comments only. Verified 2026-08-12 by diffing the V26.08.12.1100 function
--   body against the live production body line by line, ignoring whitespace: every
--   difference is a comment. No executable statement changes here.
--
-- WHERE THIS ACTUALLY APPLIES
--   Only fresh and test databases. In UAT and production the gdpr objects are owned by
--   techaid_admin and Flyway runs as the app role, so the guard below makes this a no-op
--   there - and it does not matter, because those two environments never had the stale
--   comments: their function came from db/admin/2026-08-13__admin_apply_gdpr_retention_
--   scope_prod.sql (and the UAT counterpart), which is clean. Confirmed by reading prosrc
--   from techaid_prod on 2026-08-12: no TEMP-REVERT marker, all three OR branches present.
--
--   The body below is that production body, copied verbatim, so a fresh database now gets
--   byte-for-byte what production runs rather than a separately-maintained near-copy.
--
-- NOT CHANGED: the view. gdpr.donors_to_archive is already identical in both places.
